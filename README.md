# A tour of Julia

This repository contains the notebooks/notes for the 2/3 day seminar that I will hold to the students of the [MHPC](https://mhpc.it), in Trieste.

The assessment will be based on the code in your copy of the repository [TourOfJuliaExamTemplate.jl](https://github.com/stefanocampanella/TourOfJuliaExamTemplate.jl).
