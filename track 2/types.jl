md""" # The Julia type system

It is possible to write simple Julia programs while being unaware of the type system in the language. These Julia programs would look very similar to the ones that unexperienced programmers would write in Python or Matlab. However, to write more complex or general programs, to debug them and to ensure good performance, it is necessary to have some understanding of the Julia type system. Fortunately, a description of the type system sufficient for the purposes of this document can be given in few notions.

According to Pierce, _"a type system is a syntactic method for automatically checking the absence of certain erroneous behaviors by classifying program phrases according to the kinds of values they compute"_. Without being too formal, I will call program phrases (like `y` or `1 + 1` or `sort(xs)`) expressions or combinations. In order to evaluate an expression, Julia must know its type, which is inferred at runtime from the type of the parts of which it is composed. This is called dynamic typing, as opposed to static typing. In Julia the concept of "static type" does not exist. 

In Julia, you have the primitive types you are familiar with from other programming languages (ex. numerical types). You can ask Julia about the type of literals and objects using the function `typeof`. If you ask for the type of an expressions in the REPL or in Pluto, it is evaluated and the result assigned to a temporary object. Notice that it is customary to name types using camel case, as with classes in Python or C++ (at least, according to most common style guides).

## Subtyping

In Julia, types form a tree. The root of the tree is called `Any` and all the types `A` descendant of a type `B` (i.e. the children of `B`, their children, and so on) is said to be a subtype of the latter: `A <: B`. 

Moreover a type is a subtype of itself, thus the subtype relation forms a preorder category, with `Any` (also called top) as its initial object. There is also a final object which is `Union{}` or bottom, which is a subtype of every type.

The nodes in this tree that cannot be instantiated are called abstract types, while the others concrete types. Every object in Julia must have a concrete type, not an abstract one. All concrete types are final (leaves in the tree). The subtype relation together with dispatch model inheritance of behaviour (but not of structure).

Abstract types are defined using the `abstract` keyword. The supertype of a type must be indicated during declaration, if omitted that type will be a subtype of `Any`.

md"""When defining a function, the programmer can indicate the type (abstract or concrete) of the arguments. Being polymorphic, there can be several definitions of the same function with different number or types of arguments. When that function is called, the Julia compiler select the most specific implementation: the one where the types of the arguments in the definition are more closely related to the actual concrete types of the arguments at the call site[^1].

[^1] The actual algorithm used by Julia is not straightforward enough to be put in a single sentence, plus there are several corner cases. However, it has been formalized and checked against alternative implementations. More information [here](https://doi.org/10.1145/3276483)"""

## Parametric Types

The Julia type system is parametric, i.e. types can depend on other things. In Julia, types can depend on other types, symbols, and values for which `isbits` returns true.

A good example is the (multidimensional) Array type, a container type which is parametric both in the elements type and in the dimensionality[^1] of the container (vectors, matrices, and higher order tensors). There are some utility functions to create arrays, like `ones`, `zeros`, `fill` or `similar`, which respectively creates arrays full of ones, zeros, arbitrary values or uninitialized arrays of the same type and shape of a given one. Let's create a vector filled with 1.0 and inspect the type of the result.

[^1] Notice that the arrays of the Julia standard library are not parametric in their sizes along dimensions. The third party package [StaticArrays](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl) provides such data structures, that can be more performant for certain algorithms (thanks, for example, to stack allocations and loop unrolling) and in certain contexts (tipically for small arrays).

### Tuple and Union type

In type systems that have both, subtyping and parametric types can interact in interesting ways. In Julia, parametric types are not covariant, which means that if `A <: B`, then `C{A} <: C{B}` does **not** hold. This is something to keep in mind when designing a type hierarchy.

However, the parametric type `Tuple{A, B, ...}` makes an exception and it's covariant in its arguments; that is if `T <: S` and `Tuple{A1, A2, ..., An} <: Tuple{B1, B2, ..., Bn}` then `Tuple{A1, A2, ..., An, T} <: Tuple{B1, B2, ..., Bn, S}`.

The reason is that this special type is used in _multiple dispatch_, something which will discuss in more detail later. The main idea is that it represents the type of the input of a function (a tuple of arguments). Quoting the Julia documentation, "_tuples are an abstraction of the arguments of a function – without the function itself_".  If we want to use subtyping in the selection of a function implementation based on its arguments, we need covariance.

Finally, several intuitive (in a set-theoretic point of view) relations holds. `Tuples` distribute over `Unions`, `Union{A, B}` is associative, and `Union{}` (the bottom value) is the neutral element with respect to `Union{A, B}`.

A more in detail description of the type system and of the reasons behind its design can be found in the [Abstraction in technical computing](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/99811) (2015), the PhD thesis of Jeff Bezanson, one of the creators Julia.

## UnionAll types

We've seen the `Function` type and the `Type` type, which are supertypes respectively of all the `Function{f}` and `Type{T}` types, where `f` is the name of a function and `T` of a type. How is this possible? If one defines a new function `g` or a new type `S`, then `Function{g} <: Function` and `Type{S} <: Type` will hold, without any explicit declaration. We can ask Julia what is the type of `Type` and `Function`.

## Singleton types

A singleton type is a type of which there is only one instance (in the category Set, a set containing only one element). Formally, `T` is a singleton type iff `a isa T && b isa T` implies `a === b` (they are identical). Such a type (there can be more than one, all isomorphic one another), are defined singleton types (the `void` type of C++ or `()`, the unit type, in Haskell).

Another singleton type is the value type `Val{T}`. Since a type parameter can a `isbits` or a `Symbol`, this singleton type hold such a value as a type parameter. It's constructor is defined as follows
```julia
Val(x) = Val{x}()
```
This type is used to pass some static informations to the compiler, which might be beneficial in certain situations.

A particular case of sigleton types are `Missing` and `Nothing`. They are similar, but they are used with different intentions and functions usually implement a method for one or the other.


On the one hand, `Missing` represents, as the name suggests, a missing value, for example in tabular data. This means that missings propagates in arithmetic operations (like NaNs) and that statistic functions usually can be instructed for skipping missings.

On the other hand, `Nothing` represents a void. For example, it is the return type of the execution of instructions that do not correspond to a value (i.e. have only side effects, as `println`) and is used to implement the C++ `std::optional` or Haskell `Maybe`.

## Type Stability
